Lists
=====

A list is created in Python by using the square brackets ([, and ]) and separating the values by commas. Here's an example list:
    
>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

There's really not a limit to how long our list can be (there is, but it's very unlikely that we'll hit it while scripting)

Reading from Lists

To access an individual element of a list you can use the index and Python uses a zero based index system.

>>> my_list[0]
1
>>> my_list[2]
3

If we try to access an index that is too high (or too low) then we'll receive an error:

>>> my_list[5]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range

To make sure that we're not trying to get an index that is out of range, we can test the length using the len function (and then subtract 1)

>>> len(my_list)
5

Additionally, we can access subsections of a list by "slicing" it. We provide the starting index and the ending index (the object at that index won't be included).

>>> my_list[0:2]
[1, 2]
>>> my_list[1:]
[2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> my_list[:3]
[1, 2, 3]
>>> my_list[0::1]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> my_list[0::2]
[1, 3, 5]

Modifying a List

Unlike strings which can't be modified (you can't change a character in a string), you can change a value in a list using the subscript equals operation:

>>> my_list[0] = "a"
>>> my_list
['a', 2, 3, 4, 5]

Items in lists can be set using slices also:

>>> my_list[0:2] = 'a'
>>> my_list
['a', 3, 4, 5]
>>> my_list[0:2] = [1, 2, 3]
>>> my_list
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> my_list[0:2] = []
>>> my_list
[3, 4, 5]

Attempting to remove an item that isn't in the list will result in an error:

>>> my_list.remove(6)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list

If the item does exist in the list then it will be removed:

>>> my_list.remove(4)
>>> my_list
[3, 5]

Items can also be removed from the end of a list using the pop method:

>>> my_list.pop()
5
>>> my_list
[3]
>>> my_list.pop()
3
>>> my_list
[]
>>> my_list.pop()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: pop from empty list

Lists can be used to create a stack and pop can be used to take the first item like this:

>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> my_list.pop(0)
1
>>> my_list
[2, 3, 4]

Adding to the list can be done in a few ways. The first of which is by using the append method:

>>> my_list.append(5)
>>> my_list
[2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> my_list.insert(1, 3)
>>> my_list
[2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
>>> my_list.insert(0, 1)
>>> my_list
[1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
